# Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview
The Vulnerability Scanner is a tool designed to identify security weaknesses in networks and web applications. It scans for open ports and verifies the presence of essential HTTP security headers, providing actionable insights for improving system security.

## Features
1. **Port Scanning**:
   - Scans common ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH, 21 for FTP, 3306 for MySQL).
   - Identifies open ports on the target system.

2. **HTTP Header Analysis**:
   - Checks for essential security headers such as:
     - `X-Content-Type-Options`
     - `X-Frame-Options`
     - `Content-Security-Policy`
   - Reports missing or misconfigured headers.

3. **Configurable Options**:
   - Customize ports to scan and headers to check via the `config.json` file.

## Installation
1. Navigate to the `vulnerability_scanner` directory:
   ```bash
   cd vulnerability_scanner
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the scanner:
   ```bash
   python scanner.py
   ```
2. Input the target URL or IP address when prompted.

## Configuration
You can customize the scanner by editing the `config.json` file:
- **`ports_to_scan`**: List of ports to check.
- **`security_headers`**: List of required HTTP headers.
- **`scan_timeout`**: Timeout duration for port scans.

## Example
### Input
Target: `http://example.com`

### Output
```
Scanning ports on example.com...
Open ports on example.com: [80, 443]
Checking HTTP headers for http://example.com...
HTTP Header Issues:
 - Missing X-Content-Type-Options
 - Missing X-Frame-Options
 - Missing Content-Security-Policy
```
